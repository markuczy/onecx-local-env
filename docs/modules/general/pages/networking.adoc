:different_ports: xref:latest@guides:general:getting-started/enable_hot_reload.adoc#note-different-ports

This document explains how networking is configured and managed in the OneCX local development environment.

== Overview

The OneCX local environment uses a sophisticated networking setup that combines:

* **Traefik** as the central reverse proxy and API gateway
* **Docker Compose networks** for service-to-service communication  
* **Host file configuration** for domain name resolution
* **Service discovery** through Docker labels
* **Environment-based configuration** for flexible deployment

== Architecture Components

=== Traefik Reverse Proxy

Traefik serves as the central entry point for all HTTP traffic in the OneCX environment. It acts as:

* **Reverse Proxy**: Routes incoming requests to appropriate backend services
* **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across service instances
* **Service Discovery**: Automatically detects new services through Docker labels
* **API Gateway**: Provides a single entry point for all microservices

==== Traefik Configuration

The Traefik configuration is split across multiple files:

* `init-data/traefik/traefik-conf.yml`: Main Traefik configuration
* `init-data/traefik/traefik-services.yml`: Static service definitions
* Docker labels in `docker-compose.v<version>.yaml`: Dynamic service registration

==== Key Traefik Settings

.traefik-conf.yml
[source,yaml]
----
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"  # HTTP entry point

providers:
  docker:
    endpoint: unix:///var/run/docker.sock  # Docker socket for service discovery
  file:
    filename: /etc/traefik/services.yml    # Static service definitions
----

=== Service Discovery and Routing

==== Traefik Labels

Services register themselves with Traefik using Docker labels:

.General Traefik Label Patterns
[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  # Define the service port (required for all services)
  - "traefik.http.services.<service-name>.loadbalancer.server.port=<port>"

  # Backend services (BFF/SVC) and Infrastructure services - simple host-based routing
  - "traefik.http.routers.<service-name>.rule=Host(`<service-name>`)"
  
  # Frontend applications - path-based routing through local-proxy
  - "traefik.http.routers.<ui-service>.rule=Host(`local-proxy`)&&PathPrefix(`/<app-path>/`)"
----

==== Routing Rules

Different routing patterns are used for different service types:

* Backend Services (BFF/SVC) and Infrastructure Services:

[source]
----
Host(`service-name`)
----

* Frontend Applications (UI):

[source]
----
Host(`local-proxy`)&&PathPrefix(`/app-path/`)
----

=== Host File Configuration

For proper domain resolution in development, the following entries should be added to your local hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on Linux/macOS, `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows):

[source]
----

127.0.0.1 keycloak-app
127.0.0.1 postgresdb

----

=== Port Mapping Strategy

==== External Ports (Host → Container)

Key external ports exposed to the host:

[cols="2,2,3"]
|===
|Service |Host Port |Purpose

|Traefik HTTP
|80
|Main HTTP entry point

|Traefik Dashboard
|8082
|Web UI for Traefik management

|Keycloak
|8080
|Identity and access management

|PostgreSQL
|5432
|Database direct access
|===

==== Internal Ports (Container → Container)

Services communicate internally using standard ports:

* **Web Services**: Port 8080 (Quarkus default)
* **PostgreSQL**: Port 5432
* **Frontend Applications**: Port 8080 (Nginx)

=== Docker Compose Networks

==== Default Network

All services are connected to the `default` (docker-compose.v2.yaml) or `example` (docker-compose.v1.yaml) Docker Compose network, which enables:

* **Service-to-Service Communication**: Services can communicate using container names as hostnames
* **Automatic DNS Resolution**: Docker provides built-in DNS for container name resolution
* **Network Isolation**: Traffic is isolated from the host network and other Docker networks

==== Network Communication Patterns

Services communicate using these patterns:

[cols="2,3,3"]
|===
|Communication Type |Example |URL Pattern

|Frontend to BFF
|Shell UI → Shell BFF
|`http://onecx-shell-bff:8080`

|BFF to Service  
|Shell BFF → Theme Service
|`http://onecx-theme-svc:8080`

|Service to Database
|Theme Service → PostgreSQL
|`jdbc:postgresql://postgresdb:5432/onecx_theme`

|Service to Keycloak
|Any Service → Keycloak
|`http://keycloak-app:8080`
|===

=== Environment Configuration

==== Common Environment Variables

Key networking-related shared environment variables in `common.env`:

.common.env
[source,env]
----
KC_REALM=onecx
QUARKUS_OIDC_AUTH_SERVER_URL=http://keycloak-app:8080/realms/${KC_REALM}
QUARKUS_OIDC_TOKEN_ISSUER=http://keycloak-app/realms/${KC_REALM}
----

==== Service-Specific Configuration

* BFF Environment (`bff.env`):
** Currently empty - BFF services inherit their networking configuration from `common.env`.

* Service Environment (`svc.env`):

[source,env]
----
TKIT_DATAIMPORT_ENABLED=true
ONECX_TENANT_CACHE_ENABLED=false
----

NOTE: Database connection URLs and authentication endpoints are typically configured directly in the `docker-compose.v2.yaml` file within each service's `environment` section, using internal Docker network hostnames like `postgresdb:5432` and `keycloak-app:8080`.

== Access Patterns

=== External Access (Browser → Services)

==== OneCX Shell (Main Entry Point)
* **Shell Admin Interface**: `http://local-proxy/onecx-shell/admin`
  - Default credentials: username `onecx`, password `onecx`
  - All OneCX applications are accessed through the Shell workspace navigation

==== Application Access Through Shell
Applications are accessed via the Shell workspace navigation. For example:

* **Workspace Management**: `http://local-proxy/onecx-shell/admin/workspace`
* The workspace UI is served from: `http://local-proxy/mfe/workspace/`
* Where the path can be found in the path prefix:
** `"traefik.http.routers.<ui-service>.rule=Host(\`local-proxy\`)&&PathPrefix(\`/mfe/**workspace**/\`)"`

==== Infrastructure Services
* **Keycloak**: `http://keycloak-app:8080` or `http://localhost:8080`
* **PgAdmin**: `http://pgadmin`
* **Traefik Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8082`

=== Internal Communication

Services communicate internally using container names:

* BFF calls services: `http://service-name:8080`
* Services call databases: `jdbc:postgresql://postgresdb:5432/db_name`
* All services authenticate via: `http://keycloak-app:8080`

== Development Workflow

=== Local Development Integration

The networking setup supports local development through:

**Host Integration**:
[source,yaml]
----
extra_hosts:
  - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
----

**Static Service Definitions** (`traefik-services.yml`):
[source,yaml]
----
http:
  services:
    local_bff:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://host.docker.internal:8585/"
    local_mfe:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://host.docker.internal:4200/"
----

NOTE: With this configuration, the local MFE/UI must run on port 4200 and the respective BFF must run on port 8585. Refer to this {different_ports}[different ports note section] for more details on changing to different ports.

== Security Considerations

=== Network Isolation

* Services are isolated within the Docker network
* Only necessary ports are exposed to the host
* Database is not directly accessible from outside (except via mapped port 5432)

=== Authentication Flow

1. Browser → Traefik (local-proxy) → Frontend Application
2. Frontend → Traefik → BFF Service
3. BFF → Keycloak (authentication)
4. BFF → Backend Services (with token)
